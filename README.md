# Discourse and Syntactic Markers as Features for Translatorship Attribution
Repository for holding code for paper submitted to IEEE Access Journal

There are two ways to reproduce the results:

1. Locally (you must have Anaconda installed)

    1. Download or clone this repository locally.
    1. Open a conda prompt inside the directory and type the following command:
        >`conda env create -n translator-attribution -f environment.yml`
        
        This will create a new environment called `translator-attibution` with the exact versions of the libraries used to produce the results.
    1. From any environment, open `jupyter lab` and you can start running the Notebooks in order (select the recently created _kernel_ --translator-attribution).

1. Remotely on Colab (you need a Google Drive account)
    
    1. Download the contents of this repository in a folder named `translator-attribution` in your Google Drive root folder.
    1. You can start running the Notebooks in colab from this repository (allow Drive to synch between steps).
